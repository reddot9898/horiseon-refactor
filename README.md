# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
This project was built to purposely break the html code which also disrupts the css file linked to it. Also starting out there are various issues within the starter code that need addressed and corrected. But with fixing those issues will then cause correlating issues with your css file that then need to also be fixed. I learned in this project how important file structures can be to a code, as well as using element tags correctly for numerous reasons. I learned how to input alt tags for images that may not load on a browser, also how to comment out work that has been done for myself or the next dev to read and remember what has been done / correct further issues. In the project I have just barely touched into all that goes into css but have learned to set text font size, color, style etc. How to move images / text around using several different commands depending on where you want said items. My motivation for this project was to further my skills and help me to start remembering all syntax in css and html.
